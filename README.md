## Out of the Vortex - Mega Drive (Genesis) ROM
#### Build with bug fixes for the unreleased Cryo game Out of the Vortex.

The original code, files, and build of the game from a development cart are at [Hidden Palace](https://hiddenpalace.org/News/Vanished_without_a_Trace_-_Out_of_the_Vortex_for_the_Sega_Mega_Drive)

Many Thanks to them for their preservation work, and many thanks to one of the original authors, Pipozor, for saving and releasing the work as he left it in 1995.

The game was brought to my attention by [twitch.tv/macaw45](twitch.tv/macaw45) who has an insatiable appetite for Cryo games. He put a bounty offer out for someone to fix the bugs impeding a satisfying playthrough. The opportunity to do some Mega Drive programming for a community passionate about the game has been irresistible.

#### There are still bugs, but it is more completable than the first rom released. 
  - See The issues tab for list of documented bugs and submit an issue to me if you find another one.
